Here’s a clear and professional way to express that in English:

"We’ve initiated a proof of concept with a partner company to explore how AI could be applied to our COBOL codebase.

If you're preparing this for a presentation or formal document, I can help polish it even more or adapt the tone to suit your audience. Curious to hear how the PoC evolves—that’s an exciting initiative!
