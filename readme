Got it! Here’s a smooth and clear way to express that in English:

"Currently, our support teams use Copilot in VS Code for all kinds of situations. However, our developers aren't yet able to do the same, as the Copilot plugin isn't available in their development environment, IDz."

If you’d like to expand on that—for example, to add context about why IDz is used or what challenges this causes—I’d be happy to help flesh it out.
