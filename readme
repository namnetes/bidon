Here’s an improved English version that includes your new point:

"This type of application is also valuable because it helps standardize the ChangeMan features made available to users. More importantly, it simplifies access to these features for certain user groups, thereby reducing both training time and the need for support.

Additionally, it offers the ability to process multiple components in bulk. For the integration of some of our software packages containing several thousand components, this makes the task significantly easier than handling each file individually."

Let me know if you’d like to adapt this for a more technical, executive, or customer-facing audience—I’d be happy to rework it.
