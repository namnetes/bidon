Of course, Magali! Hereâ€™s the English version of your thank-you message with the original humor intact:

Hi [First Name],

Thank you so much for your messageâ€”it really made me smile! Can you believe itâ€™s already been 5 years since I joined the teamâ€¦ and 5 years of sailing the high seas of updates, fixes, and urgent requests with ChangeMan by my side. We've certainly come a long way togetherâ€”me and my trusty deployment sidekick.

At this point, Iâ€™m thinking if I get to celebrate 5 years of service, ChangeMan deserves a medal tooâ€”for putting up with me all this time ðŸ˜„

Thanks again for your kind note! Looking forward to continuing our great collaboration (and our unforgettable conversations about our favorite bugs!).

Talk soon,  
Magali

If youâ€™d like to personalize it more, or tweak the tone to be cheekier or more professional, Iâ€™d be happy to help!
