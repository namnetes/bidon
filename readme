Here’s a warm and thoughtful message you could say in English:

"Wishing you all the very best for this wonderful new chapter. May your maternity leave be filled with joy, tenderness, and unforgettable moments with your little one. Enjoy every bit of this precious time!"

Would you like a version that’s more casual, formal, or maybe with a touch of humor?
